## ℹ️ Why Not CRX Files?

You might be wondering why we don't use `.crx` files like some extensions. Here's why:

### Chrome's Security Policy

Since Chrome 75+, Google blocks CRX files that aren't from the Chrome Web Store with the error:

```
Package is invalid: 'CRX_REQUIRED_PROOF_MISSING'
```

This is intentional security policy. Google only allows CRX installation from:

- ✅ Chrome Web Store (official distribution)
- ✅ Enterprise Policy (for companies)
- ❌ Self-signed CRX files (blocked for security)

### Our Approach: ZIP + Load Unpacked

This method is:

- ✅ **Simple**: Extract and load - takes 30 seconds
- ✅ **Secure**: You can inspect the code before installing
- ✅ **Works everywhere**: No store approval needed
- ✅ **Auto-updates**: When you reload the extension
- ✅ **Open source**: Full transparency

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Manifest file is missing or unreadable"

**Problem**: Wrong folder selected

**Solution**: Make sure you're selecting the folder that contains `manifest.json`, not the parent folder or ZIP file.

### Extension doesn't appear on Swagger UI pages

**Problem**: Page might not be using Swagger UI

**Solution**:

1. Verify it's a Swagger/OpenAPI page
2. Try refreshing the page (F5)
3. Check the sidebar isn't hidden (look for toggle button on the right edge)

### Extension is disabled

**Problem**: Chrome automatically disabled it

**Solution**:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find SwaggerNav
3. Toggle it back ON

### "Developer mode extensions" warning

**Problem**: Chrome shows a warning banner at the top

**Solution**: This is normal for unpacked extensions. You can:

- Ignore it (harmless)
- Dismiss it each time Chrome starts
- Wait for Chrome Web Store version (coming soon)

### Extension disappeared after Chrome restart

**Problem**: The extension folder was moved or deleted

**Solution**:

1. Don't move or delete the extension folder
2. Keep it in a permanent location (e.g., `~/Extensions/SwaggerNav`)
3. Reinstall if the folder was removed

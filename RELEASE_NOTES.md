## 🎉 What's New in v1.0.8

### **New: Liquid Glass (Optional)**

- ✨ Added an optional **Liquid Glass** mode that applies iOS-style glassmorphism on top of your Swagger background
- 🌙 Tuned for both light and dark themes, including dropdowns, collapsible sections, and the SwaggerNav sidebar
- 🧊 Response JSON/code blocks now **keep their solid dark background** for perfect readability (no glass overlay)
- 🎛️ Liquid Glass is **OFF by default** and can be toggled in the options page under "Enhanced Features"

### **Fixes & Polish**

- 🎨 Adjusted button labels (Try it out / Cancel / Execute) for better contrast on Liquid Glass
- 🔍 Improved parameter search dropdown layering so it floats correctly above glass panels
